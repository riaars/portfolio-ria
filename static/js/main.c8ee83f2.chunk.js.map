The charity\n                  organization would get notification by phone after the\n                  Matbanken received the food grom groceries. However, they did\n                  not truly know what was existed in the Matbanken. They have\n                  they system but not all integrated.

However, it did not work well. We figured it\n                  out that to solve the problem, we need to focus on one\n                  problem. In this design solution, we created the platform,\n                  e-commerce a like, that will be used by charity organization\n                  and the Matbanken customers to make an order . The charity\n                  organization did not need any phone call to check the food\n                  availability and set the appointment to pick up the food.\n                  Meanwhile, the customer did not need to wait for hours on\n                  quueu to bring back the cheap food home. Therefore, it could\n                  solve one of the issue in Matbanken, reducing the food\n                  quantities that become the food waste. We also suggested the\n                  imporvement of the current website of Matbanken. They had the\n                  platform to record the incoming products, however the existing\n                  dashboard did not have the product tracking by expiry dates.\n                  By having the expiry date column and also created the “will\n                  expire today food” we can help them to manage the storage\n                  easily. Another challenge we had was the difficulty to test to\n                  the Matbanken staff, that we then found a way by testing to\n                  the people which have similar daily jobs, like factory staff\n                  and student which has experience before.\n                </p>\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </React.Fragment>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default ProjectDetailFood;\n","import React, {Component} from 'react';\n\nclass ProjectDetailBookio extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <React.Fragment>\n        <div className=\"container\">\n          <div className=\"row\">\n            <div className=\"project-info col-lg-3 col-sm-12\">\n              <div>\n                <b>Client: </b>\n                Interaction Programming and the Dynamic Web Final Project KTH\n                Royal Institute of Technology\n                <div className=\"space\"></div>\n                <b>Role: </b>\n                User Research, prototyping, UI Design, and Front End engineer.\n                <div className=\"space\"></div>\n                <b>Technology: </b>\n                Sketch, Invision\n                <div className=\"space\"></div>\n                <b>Website: </b>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"project-description col-lg-9 col-sm-12\">\n              <p>\n                BOOKIO is a leading book sharing platform that connects the\n                people who want to give or lend their books away to the people\n                who want to read a book without buying it.

We gave the\n                  solution by offering two platforms, farmer and tourist.\n                  However, the farmer living in non-english speaker country\n                  might have a language barrier on understanding the platform\n                  and all the procedure in it. By providing the language\n                  translator, it will be easier for both parties to communicate.\n                </p>\n                <b>High Fidelity Prototype</b>\n                <b>Tourist Application</b>\n                <div>\n                  <img\n                    className=\"cover\"\n                    src={require('../../images/harvest-1.png')}\n                    alt=\"cover-food-bank\"\n                  />\n                </div>\n                <b>Farmer Application</b>\n                <div>\n                  <img\n                    className=\"cover\"\n                    src={require('../../images/harvest-2.png')}\n                    alt=\"cover-food-bank\"\n                  />\n                </div>\n                <b>Usability Testing</b>\n                <p className=\"interview\">\n                  We conducted the usability testing to our target users.

With this condition, most children will stay at home\n                  preferred to play with the computer. This condition makes them\n                  rarely exercise. This research will try to find the\n                  opportunities and challenges in designing the playground that\n                  is suitable for the dark-winter condition while considering\n                  playfulness to support social interaction among children. The\n                  object study in designing winter playground is focused on the\n                  climbing-nets.\n                </p>\n                <div className=\"space\"></div>\n                <div className=\"detail-header\">Design Concepts</div>\n                <p className=\"detail-content\">\n                  We created three models of interaction. The first was the idle\n                  mode when no interaction happened. Idle mode aims to inform\n                  potential players that the climbing-nets offers an uncommon\n                  thing to attract children to try it. The second is the\n                  single-player mode. When the interaction happened, LEDs will\n                  light up and certain music according to the location will be\n                  played. These two will stop when the interaction is over. The\n                  last is the multi-player interaction when more than one\n                  interaction happened at the same time and producing mixed\n                  music\n                </p>\n                <div>\n                  <img\n                    className=\"cover\"\n                    src={require('../../images/climbing-net-design.svg')}\n                    alt=\"climbing-net-design\"\n                  />\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"space\"></div>\n                <div className=\"detail-header\">Design Challenges</div>\n                <div className=\"detail-content\">\n                  We identified two main challenges in designing interactive\n                  climbing-nets. The first challenge is avoiding the cacophony\n                  for multi-player model and producing nice music combination.\n                  The second challenge is finding suitable materials that will\n                  work in cold winter (expectedto work below -20C).\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"space\"></div>\n                <div className=\"detail-header\">Development Phase</div>\n                <div>\n                  <div className=\"detail-header\">1. Small Prototype</div>\n                  <div className=\"detail-content\">\n                    At the beginning of development, we created a small\n                    prototype to visualize how the final climbing-net will look\n                    in a small dimension and to see whether the design concept\n                    is possible. We created a half-sphere shape structure to put\n                    climbing-nets from a piece of wood with 26 cm diameter base\n                    and 9 cm diameter top. The nets consist of 4 rows and eight\n                    columns created from the fishing string.\n                  </div>\n                  <div className=\"project-image\">\n                    <img\n                      className=\"cover\"\n                      src={require('../../images/small-prototype.svg')}\n                      alt=\"small prototype \"\n                    />\n                    <p> Small Prototype</p>\n                  </div>\n\n                  <div className=\"detail-header\">2. Final Prototype</div>\n                  <div className=\"detail-content\">\n                    We chose the transparent tube with 10mm diameters as the\n                    packaging to protect electronic components from the extreme\n                    weather conditions. With its flexibility characteristics,\n                    the tube will not limit the user movement while emitting the\n                    light from the LEDs. We decided to change the capacitive\n                    sensors since it will not be working in winter due to sensor\n                    affordance. During winter, most people playing in the\n                    playground will use the gloves. The gloves from fabric\n                    materials cannot trigger the capacitive sensor. We explored\n                    three alternatives of replacement capacitive sensors: flex\n                    sensor; pressure resistor; button. We conducted the\n                    performance test on them and inserted them to our chosen\n                    tubes. The force sensor is not working well inside the nets\n                    while the button required high force to push them.\n                    Therefore, we decided to use the flex sensors. Flex sensor\n                    supports the bending but not very sensitive on small\n                    movement. Also, with its small width dimension, flex sensors\n                    can be inserted into the tube easily. At a later step, we\n                    inserted RGB LED strips (WS2812b) to the tube. We programmed\n                    LED strips differently on each row with different colour set\n                    up. We connected the LED strips and sensors output with\n                    wires and connected them to Arduino Uno pins. We programmed\n                    the controller to read the bending sensor that will trigger\n                    the music and light up the LEDs. When more than one rows are\n                    bending together, the LEDs for those rows will light up and\n                    the music coming from each row will be mixed. We also\n                    programmed 16 random running individual LEDs to light up\n                    when there is no interaction occurs. These random LEDs will\n                    stop when the user starts interacting with the nets.\n                  </div>\n                  <div className=\"project-image\">\n                    <img\n                      className=\"cover\"\n                      src={require('../../images/final-prototype.svg')}\n                      alt=\"final prototype \"\n                    />\n                    <p> Final Prototype testing in the playground</p>\n                  </div>\n\n                  <div className=\"space\"></div>\n                  <div className=\"detail-header\">Evaluation</div>\n                  <div className=\"detail-content\">\n                    We brought our product to do user testing in a real outdoor\n                    playground. However, since winter still in a few months, we\n                    could not test our product with a real winter environment.\n                    Alternatively, we decided to go in a dark situation and\n                    tested it after sunset. Before testing, we have surveyed\n                    nearby playground that has the climbing-nets in Ekoparken\n                    Lekplats and measure the dimension as our product size\n                    references. We built two pieces of the human-scale\n                    prototypes that resembled the actual of climbing-nets that\n                    can be tied into the traditional climbing-nets. We observed\n                    that at the beginning, the children did not understand what\n                    happened when they climbed up the nets. After they stepped\n                    their foot on the nets, the music started playing, and the\n                    LED lights up. At the second attempt, they tried to jump on\n                    the rope tried to step on different rows to see whether the\n                    music or the light colour would be different. Our fragile\n                    installation did not support their enthusiasm to play with\n                    our nets. After several times, the tube did not go back to\n                    the initial position. Therefore the music and LEDs kept\n                    going on. We figured it out that putting flexible tubes\n                    which tend to bend to the rope was not a right decision. For\n                    future work, we plan to change it to more flexible\n                    materials.\n                  </div>\n                  <div className=\"project-image\">\n                    <img\n                      className=\"cover\"\n                      src={require('../../images/climbingnet-testing.svg')}\n                      alt=\"evaluation prototype \"\n                    />\n                    <p> Physical Interaction Exhibition</p>\n                  </div>\n                  <div className=\"space\"></div>\n                  <div className=\"detail-header\">Lesson Learned</div>\n                  <div className=\"detail-content ml-4\">\n                    <ol>\n                      <li>\n                        Material exploration is essential.
