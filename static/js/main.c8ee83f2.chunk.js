Final Prototype"),o.a.createElement("div",{className:"detail-content"},"We chose the transparent tube with 10mm diameters as the packaging to protect electronic components from the extreme weather conditions. With its flexibility characteristics, the tube will not limit the user movement while emitting the light from the LEDs. We decided to change the capacitive sensors since it will not be working in winter due to sensor affordance. During winter, most people playing in the playground will use the gloves. The gloves from fabric materials cannot trigger the capacitive sensor. We explored three alternatives of replacement capacitive sensors: flex sensor; pressure resistor; button. We conducted the performance test on them and inserted them to our chosen tubes. The force sensor is not working well inside the nets while the button required high force to push them. Therefore, we decided to use the flex sensors. Flex sensor supports the bending but not very sensitive on small movement. Also, with its small width dimension, flex sensors can be inserted into the tube easily. At a later step, we inserted RGB LED strips (WS2812b) to the tube. We programmed LED strips differently on each row with different colour set up. We connected the LED strips and sensors output with wires and connected them to Arduino Uno pins. We programmed the controller to read the bending sensor that will trigger the music and light up the LEDs. When more than one rows are bending together, the LEDs for those rows will light up and the music coming from each row will be mixed. We also programmed 16 random running individual LEDs to light up when there is no interaction occurs. These random LEDs will stop when the user starts interacting with the nets."),o.a.createElement("div",{className:"project-image"},o.a.createElement("img",{className:"cover",src:a(18),alt:"final prototype "}),o.a.createElement("p",null," Final Prototype testing in the playground")),o.a.createElement("div",{className:"space"}),o.a.createElement("div",{className:"detail-header"},"Evaluation"),o.a.createElement("div",{className:"detail-content"},"We brought our product to do user testing in a real outdoor playground.

Before testing, we have surveyed nearby playground that has the climbing-nets in Ekoparken Lekplats and measure the dimension as our product size references. We built two pieces of the human-scale prototypes that resembled the actual of climbing-nets that can be tied into the traditional climbing-nets. We observed that at the beginning, the children did not understand what happened when they climbed up the nets. After they stepped their foot on the nets, the music started playing, and the LED lights up. At the second attempt, they tried to jump on the rope tried to step on different rows to see whether the music or the light colour would be different. Our fragile installation did not support their enthusiasm to play with our nets. After several times, the tube did not go back to the initial position. Therefore the music and LEDs kept going on.
